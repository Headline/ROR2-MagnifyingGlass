# Lens Maker's Magnifying Glass
Ever wanted more damage with your crit? Well here you go!

## Implementation
On hit, if you crit, the magnifying glass will increase your hit damage based on the amount of magnifying glasses you have. With diminish returns, you can expect to max out at around 10 of these for a total of 200% damage per crit. Expect balance changes in the future based off of user feedback.
